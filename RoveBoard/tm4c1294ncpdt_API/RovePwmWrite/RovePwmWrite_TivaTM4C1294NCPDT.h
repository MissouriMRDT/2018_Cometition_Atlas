**This library is used to generate a PWM wave on the TI tiva tm4c1294ncpdt board, using its internal hardware PWM module (the board has just one, it makes 8 outputs).
**There are a total of eight GPIO pins which are capable of using the PWM function,
**and eight possible PWM waves can be generated at a single time.
*The library is split into 3 functions. The first one is the simplest, emulating the arduino standard of just putting in the duty cycle and the pin to output it on, using the arduino
*default pwm frequency of 490 hz. The next two let you specify more advanced functionalities.
*
*Pins that can output pwm with this library and thus be passed to the functions in this library using the roveboard pinmap standard:
*(note again that pins that share a generator will have the same settings except for pulse width)
* PF_0 (generator 0)
* PF_1 (generator 0)
* PF_2 (generator 1)
* PF_3 (generator 1)
* PG_0 (generator 2)
* PG_1 (generator 2)
* PK_4 (generator 3)
* PK_5 (generator 3)
*
*Warning: While 8 outputs can be made at once, and they can all have unique pulse widths, two of each are paired and will have the same pulse frequency and
*other pulse settings. This is because the pwm module on the tiva has four internal generators: These generators are what make the pwm output. Each generator
*has two pwm outputs, and is capable of making them have different pulse widths, but it forces them to share the same settings otherwise.
*Keep this in mind when selecting pins, choose the pins wisely so as to not cause conflicxs for the PWM outputs.
*If you do try to give all 8 different settings, they'll just be overwritten
*
*
* Warning: Timing notices:
* The minimum waveform frequency that can be output is 29 hz, with an accuracy of .53 microseconds (though only 1 microsecond of difference can be input to the lib anyway).
* These are the best conditions, and the best conditions are when the system clock is 120Mhz/2^n (120, 60, 30...), up to 1.875 Mhz.
* When the system clock isn't 120Mhz/2^n, then the minimum frequency increases, potentially up to 57 hz at worst.
* To calculate your new mininum frequency yourself, use this formula if you're using a clock freq that isn't 120Mhz/n^n:
*
* minimum freq = (clock F / divisor) / 65535, where divisor = {
*   64, F = 120Mhz
*   32, 60Mhz <= F < 120Mhz
*   16, 30Mhz <= F < 60Mhz
*   8,  15Mhz <= F < 30Mhz
*   4,  7.5Mhz <= F < 15Mhz
*   2,  3.75Mhz <= F < 7.5Mhz
*   1,  1.875Mhz <= F < 3.75Mhz
*   }
*
*   Minimum freq for the system clock to use this library is 1.875Mhz. Below that, the pwmwrite functions shall not do anything.
*   In all these cases, the functions shall have at least an accuracy of 1 microsecond of change
