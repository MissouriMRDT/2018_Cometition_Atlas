/* Programmer: Drue Satterfield, Jimmy Haviland
 * Date of creation: Original program: sometime 2016. Revised for roveboard: September 2017
 * Microcontroller used: Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT
 * Hardware components used by this file: Potentially all I2C modules, 0 - 9; hardware has to be explicitely initialized for usage by the user
 *
 * Description: This library is used to read and write data to and from devices with the I2C protocol, based off of the chip's
 * internal hardware I2C modules. This library uses the roveboard pin mapping standard, for passing pins to the functions.
 * Refer to the roveboard github's wiki for more info.
 *
 * The functions are generally built to be non blocking; they'll return immediately if they think that the line is already in usage
 * by another master or if they detect an error in transmission. The one holdup will be if the slave(s) tries to hold the clock line
 * low; after a period of time, the function will time out in this condition. The timeout value is 1/(baud rate / 4080) seconds.
 *
 * A secondary timeout is included for security purposes; if for any reason the module takes more than 10 milliseconds to transmit a byte,
 * or to get started in the first place, the function will automatically return and report a timeout error. See the below warning on
 * what to do in this situation.
 *
 * Module     clock/SCL pin(s)    data/SDA pin(s)
 *   0              PB_2              PB_3
 *   1              PG_0              PG_1
 *   2        PL_1, PP_5, PN_5     PL_0, PN_4
 *   3              PK_4              PK_5
 *   4              PK_6              PK_7
 *   5           PB_0, PB_4        PB_1, PB_5
 *   6              PA_6              PA_7
 *   7           PD_0, PA_4        PD_1, PA_5
 *   8           PD_2, PA_2        PD_3, PA_3
 *   9              PA_0              PA_1
 *
 *
 * Warnings:
 * The hardware only supports 7 bit addressing for the slaves, for a maximum of 127 slave devices on one module.
 *
 * If the function returns a timeout error -- or a busy error with one master on the line -- then the i2c module will reset itself internally
 *    and pulse the clock pin repeatedly in order to force the i2c line to reset.
 * If the receiving device still won't talk, try toggling the sda and scl pins on and off a few times with digital write
