#ifndef DIGITALPIN_TIVATM4C1294NCPDT_H_
#define DIGITALPIN_TIVATM4C1294NCPDT_H_

/* Programmer: Drue Satterfield
 * Date of creation: September 2017
 * Microcontroller used: Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT
 * Hardware components used by this file: Potentially all GPIO pins. Pins are explicitely called into usage by the user
 * and when not initialized can be used by other hardware components.
 *
 * Description: This library is used to input and output digital signals on GPIO pins (digital signals = just a high voltage
 * representing bit 1, or a low voltage for bit 0). Voltage is in CMOS for the tivac, IE 3.3V for 1 and 0V for 0.
 * As well, the user can choose to modify the pin's setting when reading or writing signals; the available settings are
 * writing in normal or open drain mode, and reading in normal mode, or with internal pull up or down resistors. More information below on those.
 *
 * This library uses the roveboard pin mapping standard, for passing pins to the functions. Refer to the roveboard github's wiki for more info.
 *
 *
 * Warnings: The functions will override each other's settings if called seperately; if a special setting is used, it must be
 * specified on each call.
 * Pin PD_7 is locked by the hardware and shouldn't be used
